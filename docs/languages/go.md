# Go Memory Leak Guide

::: info Coming Soon
This comprehensive guide for Go memory leak detection and prevention is currently being developed.

We welcome contributions from the community! If you'd like to help write this guide, please:

- Fork the repository
- Create your content following our documentation standards
- Submit a pull request

This guide will cover:

- Go-specific memory leak patterns
- Goroutine leak detection and prevention
- Memory profiling with pprof
- Garbage collector optimization
- Production monitoring strategies

:::

## What Will Be Covered

### Go Memory Management

- Go memory model and garbage collector
- Stack vs heap allocation
- Escape analysis
- Memory layout and alignment

### Common Go Memory Leak Patterns

- Goroutine leaks (blocked or infinite goroutines)
- Slice capacity issues and memory retention
- Map key accumulation
- Channel buffer leaks
- Defer statement accumulation
- Time.After in loops

### Go-Specific Tools

- **go tool pprof** - Built-in profiling tool
- **go tool trace** - Execution tracer
- **runtime/pprof** - Programmatic profiling
- **net/http/pprof** - HTTP profiling endpoint
- **Continuous profiling** (Pyroscope, Grafana Phlare)

### Production Monitoring

- Setting up pprof endpoints
- Memory monitoring dashboards
- Alerting on memory usage
- Performance regression detection

### Framework-Specific Considerations

- Gin/Echo web frameworks
- gRPC services
- Database connection pools
- Microservices patterns
