- **Code Reviews**: Review for memory leak patterns
- **Documentation**: Document memory-sensitive areas

### Monitoring Strategies

- **Baseline Establishment**: Create memory baselines for each service
- **Threshold Alerting**: Set language-appropriate thresholds
- **Trend Analysis**: Monitor long-term memory trends
- **Incident Response**: Have language-specific debugging procedures

### Architecture Considerations

- **Service Boundaries**: Design with memory isolation in mind
- **Data Flow**: Minimize cross-service memory dependencies
- **Scaling Strategy**: Plan for memory scaling patterns
- **Technology Mix**: Consider memory implications of polyglot architectures

## Migration and Integration

### Language Migration Considerations

When migrating between languages, consider:

- **Memory Model Differences**: GC vs manual vs hybrid management
- **Performance Characteristics**: Different memory performance profiles
- **Tooling**: Available profiling and monitoring tools
- **Team Expertise**: Learning curve for memory debugging

### Polyglot Architecture Memory Management

- **Service Isolation**: Memory issues in one service don't affect others
- **Monitoring Consistency**: Unified monitoring across different languages
- **Shared Resources**: Careful management of shared caches, databases
- **Communication Overhead**: Memory impact of inter-service communication
