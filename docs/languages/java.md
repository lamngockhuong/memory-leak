::: info Coming Soon
This comprehensive guide for Java memory leak detection and prevention is currently being developed.

We welcome contributions from the community! If you'd like to help write this guide, please:

- Fork the repository
- Create your content following our documentation standards
- Submit a pull request

This guide will cover:

- Java-specific memory leak patterns
- JVM heap analysis
- Garbage collection optimization
- Tools like JProfiler, VisualVM, and Eclipse MAT
- Best practices for enterprise Java applications

:::

## What Will Be Covered

### Memory Management in Java

- JVM memory structure
- Heap vs Stack memory
- Garbage collection mechanisms
- Memory pools and generations

### Common Java Memory Leak Patterns

- Static collections that grow indefinitely
- Listeners and callbacks not properly removed
- ThreadLocal variables not cleaned up
- Connection leaks in database/network operations
- Inner class references to outer classes

### Detection Tools

- **JProfiler** - Commercial profiling tool
- **VisualVM** - Free visual profiler
- **Eclipse MAT** - Memory analyzer tool
- **JConsole** - Built-in monitoring tool
- **Java Flight Recorder** - Low-overhead profiling

### Framework-Specific Issues

- Spring application context leaks
- Hibernate session management
- Servlet container memory issues
- Microservices memory optimization
