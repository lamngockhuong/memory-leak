# Node.js Memory Leak Guide

::: info Coming Soon
This comprehensive guide for Node.js memory leak detection and prevention is currently being developed.

We welcome contributions from the community! If you'd like to help write this guide, please:

- Fork the repository
- Create your content following our documentation standards
- Submit a pull request

This guide will cover:

- Node.js-specific memory leak patterns
- V8 heap analysis and optimization
- Production monitoring and alerting
- Framework-specific considerations
- Microservices memory management

:::

## What Will Be Covered

### Node.js Memory Management

- V8 JavaScript engine internals
- Event loop and memory implications
- Buffer and stream memory handling
- Cluster mode considerations

### Common Node.js Memory Leak Patterns

- Event emitter listener accumulation
- Unclosed file descriptors and streams
- Global variable accumulation
- Closure-based memory retention
- Promise chain leaks
- Buffer allocation without cleanup
- Database connection pool leaks

### Node.js-Specific Tools

- **Node.js Inspector** (--inspect flag)
- **Clinic.js** - Performance monitoring suite
- **0x** - Single-command flamegraph profiling
- **heapdump** - Heap snapshot generation
- **memwatch-next** - Memory usage monitoring
- **Chrome DevTools** for heap analysis

### Framework Considerations

- **Express.js** middleware memory patterns
- **NestJS** dependency injection and memory
- **Fastify** plugin memory management
- **Socket.io** connection handling
- **GraphQL** resolver memory patterns

### Production Monitoring

- PM2 memory monitoring
- Docker container memory limits
- Kubernetes memory management
- APM tools integration (New Relic, DataDog)
- Custom health check endpoints

### Performance Optimization

- Memory usage profiling strategies
- Garbage collection tuning
- Stream processing best practices
- Caching strategies and memory bounds
